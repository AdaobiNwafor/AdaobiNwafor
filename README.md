**Home Loan Prediction**
This is my first data science project. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The aim of this was, using the the train and test data, predict if loan requests would be accepted and find correlations between the different variables. Using libraries such as **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost** .The variables consisted of 'Gender', 'Married', 'Self Employed', 'Education', 'Applicant income'. 'Coapplicant income', 'Loan amount', 'Loan term', 'Credit history' 'Property area' and 'Loan Status'. **Using scikit-learn and predictive models, I found correlations between the variables to determine if one variable had more of an effect over the other to grant an approved loan status.** #

**Random Walks** 
Python was used to **generate data** for a random walk, **Matplotlib** was then used to **create a visually appealing representation** of the data. 
A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, which are left to chance. Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry and economics. 
**Classes and Attributes** were used within this code, as well as while loops. 

A plot for a random walk was originally made. I proceeded then to make visual changes, such as colour schemes (sequencial and divergent), I also modified the sizes of the individual plot. 
I then placed tags that would show where the beginning and end of the random path would be.
After then, I managed to make a colour scheme that would show the direction of the path, as the colour gradient went from light to dark, it would show the path of the random walk. 

**Pictures are included, showing all the different variations of the plots**

**Scatter Plots**
This is a python code for a few simple line and scatter plots made. **Using matplotlib to create visually appealling scatter and line graphs**
