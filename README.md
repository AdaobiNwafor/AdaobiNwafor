**Home Loan Prediction**
This is my first data science project. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The aim of this was, using the the train and test data, predict if loan requests would be accepted and find correlations between the different variables. Using libraries such as **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost** .The variables consisted of 'Gender', 'Married', 'Self Employed', 'Education', 'Applicant income'. 'Coapplicant income', 'Loan amount', 'Loan term', 'Credit history' 'Property area' and 'Loan Status'. **Using scikit-learn and predictive models, I found correlations between the variables to determine if one variable had more of an effect over the other to grant an approved loan status.** #

**Scatter Plots**
This is a python code for a few simple line and scatter plots made. **Using matplotlib to create visually appealling scatter and line graphs**
